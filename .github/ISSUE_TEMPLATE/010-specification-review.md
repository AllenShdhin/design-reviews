こんにちは TAG-さん!

I'm requesting a TAG review of [feature name].

[One paragraph summary of idea, ideally copy-pasted from Explainer introduction]

  - Explainer¹ (minimally containing user needs and example code): [url]
  - Security and Privacy self-review²: [url]
  - [ ] We have reviewed the TAG's [Web Platform Design Principles](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/)

**Discussion about the work:**

  - User research: [url to public summary/results of research]
  - Tests: [url] | [wpt folder(s), if available]
  - Key pieces of existing multi-stakeholder³ (e.g. developers, implementers, civil society) support, review or discussion of this specification:
    - Chromium comments: [url]
    - Mozilla comments: https://github.com/mozilla/standards-positions/issues/NNN
    - WebKit comments: https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/NNN
    - Etc.
  - Major unresolved issues with or opposition to this design:

**Where / by whom the work is being done:**

  - GitHub repo: [url]
  - Primary contacts (and their relationship to the specification):
      - [name] ([github username]), [organization/s] (repeat as necessary, we recommend including group chairs and editors in this list)
  - Organization/project driving the design: [organization and/or project name]
  - External status/issue trackers for this feature (publicly visible, e.g. Chrome Status):
  - The group where the incubation/design work on this is being done (or is intended to be done in the future):
  - The group where standardization of this work is intended to be done ("unknown" if not known):
  - This work is being funded by:

**You should also know that:**

  - [please tell us anything else you think is relevant to this review]

CAREFULLY READ AND DELETE CONTENT BELOW THIS LINE BEFORE SUBMITTING

Please preview the issue and check that the links work before submitting.

In particular:
* if anything links to a URL which requires authentication (e.g. Google document), please make sure anyone with the link can access the document. We would prefer public documents though, since we work in the open.

¹ For background, see our [explanation of how to write a good explainer](https://tag.w3.org/explainers/). We recommend the explainer to be in [Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

² Even for early-stage ideas, a Security and Privacy questionnaire helps us understand potential security and privacy issues and mitigations for your design, and can save us asking redundant questions. See https://www.w3.org/TR/security-privacy-questionnaire/.

³ For your own organization, you can simply state the organization's position instead of linking to it. Chromium doesn't have a standards-positions repository and [prefers](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:docs/standards/positions/GoogleChrome/README.md) to use comments from the teams that maintain the relevant area of their codebase.
